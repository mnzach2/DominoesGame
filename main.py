# TO DO:
# Create 2 players from CPlayer
# Have them draw 7 tiles each from CRandom
# Pick a tile as the starter
# Players play tiles if they can connect them, or draw from boneyard until they can
# Winner is whoever is out of tiles first
# Tie if neither player can play and boneyard is empty
# Keep track of what is playable where in CDominos
